# Voice-Assistant
A python project that allows you to speak to a virtual assistant and to make it do some tasks.

## Installation:
To use this programme, a bunch of libraries must be installed in the local machine:
  1. SpeechRecognition
  2. pyttsx3
  3. sotipy
  4. pygooglenews
  5. playsound
  6. pywhatkit
  7. configparser
Thanks to all the creators of these libraries for helping me and other people create these projects!

## Maintenance:
If you want to report a bug or suggest a feature, write to me at ldvcoding@gmail.com  
The programme is not concluded yet, so it could still be a little buggy.
