# Voice-Assistant
A python project that allows you to speak to a virtual assistant and to make it do some tasks.

## Installation:
To use this programme, a bunch of libraries must be installed in the local machine:
  1. SpeechRecognition
  2. pyttsx3
  3. sotipy
  4. pygooglenews
  5. playsound
  6. pywhatkit
  7. configparser
Thanks to all the creators of these libraries for helping me and other people create these projects!

## Maintenance:
If you want to report a bug or suggest a feature, write to me at ldvcoding@gmail.com  
The programme is not concluded yet, so it could still be a little buggy.  


## Tasks:
  1. Search for music either from youtube or spotify
  2. Make some question (asking what time is it)  
  3. Change the default music platform (youtube/spotify)
  4. Read the news from (Google News)[https://news.google.com/] (you can specify how many articles' title the assistant has to read, default=5)
  5. Set a task. The assistant gonna ask you whick date and time to set an alarm
  6. Get a random number. (you can specify the minimum and maximum numbers, default=0, 10)

## Language:
The language is set to italian, both for speech recognition and voice synthesis. 
To change it, you'll need to edit the script.

## Future implementations:
Next updates gonna:
